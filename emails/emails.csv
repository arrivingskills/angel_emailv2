Thank you for your patience. We've identified the issue with your API integration.

The 403 errors were caused by a recent change to our OAuth scopes. Your application needs to request the 'data:read:v2' scope in addition to the existing ones.

Steps to fix:
1. Update your OAuth configuration to include scope 'data:read:v2'
2. Re-authorize your application
3. Regenerate your access tokens

We've also extended your rate limit to 10,000 requests/hour as a courtesy for the inconvenience.

Please let us know if you need further assistance.

Best regards,
Technical Support Team
